After running through these scenarios, you can look at how you can implement GuardDuty and associated automated remediation workflows in a multi-account structure so you are able to aggregate findings from other accounts and use the service in a more scalable manner. Admin privileges : Ensure you are using an AWS IAM User with Admin privileges. AWS CLI : You will be using the AWS CLI for simulating one of the attacks so be sure you have installed on your local machine. All of the links assume you are using the us-west-2 (Oregon) region. Getting Started \u2013 Just Two Clicks Follow these steps to enable GuardDuty: First Click : Navigate to the GuardDuty console (us-west-2) and click Get Started . Second Click : On the next screen click Enable GuardDuty . Data sources That is all you need to do. There are no prerequisites you need to set up, no agents to install, and no hardware to configure. From the moment you enable GuardDuty it begins analyzing all of the VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail logs, and DNS Logs in that region. DNS Logs are generated from the default AWS DNS resolvers used for your VPCs and are not an available data source to customers. If you are using a 3rd party DNS resolver or if you set up your own DNS resolvers, then GuardDuty cannot access, process, and identify threats from that data source. GuardDuty accesses all of these data sources without any of them having to be enabled; although it is a best practice to enable CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs for your own analysis. GuardDuty is a regional service so in order for the service to monitor these data sources in other regions you will need to enable it in those regions. You can accomplish this by following the same steps above and enabling it through the console but most customers are using the APIs to programmatically enable it in all regions and across multiple accounts. Regardless of the number of VPCs, IAM users, or other AWS resources in your account, there is no impact to your resources because all of the processing is being done within the managed service. The pricing for GuardDuty is based on the quantity of AWS CloudTrail Events analyzed and the volume of Amazon VPC Flow Log and DNS Log data analyzed (per GB). Each region in an AWS Account has a free 30-day trial to better forecast what the cost of the service will be. Findings Now that GuardDuty is enabled it is actively monitoring the three data sources for malicious or unauthorized behavior as it relates to your EC2 instances and AWS IAM Principals. You should be taken directly to the Findings tab which will show finding details as GuardDuty detects them. After deploying the scenario, you will start to see GuardDuty findings being detected. Each finding is broken down into the following format to allow for a concise yet readable description of potential security issues. ThreatPurpose : ResourceTypeAffected / ThreatFamilyName . ThreatFamilyVariant ! Artifact Click here for a description of each part. The more advanced behavioral and machine learning detections require a baseline (7 - 14 days) to be established so GuardDuty is able to learn the regular behavior and identity anomalies. An example of a finding that requires a baseline would be if an EC2 instance started communicating with a remote host on an unusual port or an IAM User who has no prior history of modifying Route Tables starts making modifications. All of the findings generated in these scenarios will be based on signatures, so the findings will be detected 10 minutes after the completion of the CloudFormation stack. The delay is due to the amount of time it takes for the information about a threat to appear in one of the data sources and the amount of time it takes for GuardDuty to access and analyze that particular data source. Click here for a complete list of current GuardDuty finding types. GuardDuty sends notifications based on Amazon CloudWatch Events when any change in the findings takes place. These notifications are sent within 5 minutes of the finding. All subsequent occurrences of an existing finding will have the same ID as the original finding and notifications will be sent every 6 hours after the initial notification. This is to eliminate alert fatigue due to the same finding. Deploy the environment AWS Sponsored Event Navigate to the Event Engine dashboard Enter your team hash code. Click AWS Console . The CloudFormation template for this round has already been prerun. Individual Launch the CloudFormation stack below to setup the GuardDuty environment: Region Deploy US West 2 (Oregon) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. Click Next on the Specify Template , Specify Details , and Options sections. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles under Capabilities and click Create . This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE . The initial findings will begin to show up in GuardDuty 10 minutes after the CloudFormation stack creation completes. What is created? The CloudFormation template will create the following resources: Three Amazon EC2 Instances (and supporting network infrastructure) Two Instances that contain the name \u201c Compromised Instance \u201d One instance that contains the name \u201c Malicious Instance \u201d AWS IAM Role For EC2 which will have permissions to SSM Parameter Store and DynamoDB One Amazon SNS Topic so you will be able to receive notifications Three AWS CloudWatch Event rules for triggering the appropriate notification or remediation Two AWS Lambda functions that will be used for remediating findings and will have permissions to modify Security Groups and revoke active IAM Role sessions (on only the IAM Role associated with this scenario) AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store value for storing a fake database password. Make sure the CloudFormation stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE status before moving on. Generate a finding manually All of the simulated attacks are automated in the CloudFormation template except for one; which requires you to take some manual steps. To produce the final finding, you will need to copy the IAM temporary security credentials from the EC2 instance and make API calls from your laptop (the calls need to come from outside the AWS network). Retrieve the IAM temporary security credentials using AWS Systems Manager To simulate this last and final attack you will need to retrieve the IAM temporary security credentials generated by the IAM Role for EC2. You can either SSH directly to the instance and query the metadata or follow the steps below to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (an SSM agent was automatically started on the instance at launch). Go to Managed Instances within the AWS Systems Manager console (us-west-2). You should see an instance named GuardDuty-Example: Compromised Instance: Scenario 3 with a ping status of Online . To see the keys currently active on the instance, click on Session Manager on the left navigation and then click Start Session . To see the credentials currently active on the instance, click on the radio button next to Compromised Instance: Scenario 3 and click Start Session . Run the following command in the shell: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/GuardDuty-Example-EC2-Compromised Make note of the AccessKeyID , SecretAccessKey , and Token . Create a new AWS CLI profile on your laptop to use the IAM temporary credentials Now that you have retrieved the IAM temporary security credentials you will need to add them to an AWS CLI profile. There are a number of ways to do this, but below are some commands to help get you started: From a command prompt, run the following commands (replace the variables with your credentials): aws configure set profile . attacker . region us - west - 2 aws configure set profile . attacker . aws_access_key_id < access_key > aws configure set profile . attacker . aws_secret_access_key < secret_key > aws configure set profile . attacker . aws_session_token < session_token > If you view your local aws credentials file, you should now see an [attacker] profile with the stolen IAM temporary credentials. Run commands using the IAM temporary credentials Now that you have your named profile you can use it to make API calls. Use the commands below to query different services to see what you have access to (don't be surprised if you see some access denied responses): Do you have any IAM permissions: aws iam get - user --profile attacker aws iam create - user --user-name Chuck --profile attacker What about DynamoDB? aws dynamodb list - tables --profile attacker aws dynamodb describe - table --table-name GuardDuty-Example-Customer-DB --profile attacker Can you query the data? aws dynamodb scan --table-name GuardDuty-Example-Customer-DB --profile attacker aws dynamodb put - item --table-name GuardDuty-Example-Customer-DB --item '{\"name\":{\"S\":\"Joshua Tree\"},\"state\":{\"S\":\"Michigan\"},\"website\":{\"S\":\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm\"}}' --profile attacker aws dynamodb scan --table-name GuardDuty-Example-Customer-DB --profile attacker aws dynamodb delete - table --table-name GuardDuty-Example-Customer-DB --profile attacker aws dynamodb list - tables --profile attacker Do you have access to Systems Manager Parameter Store? aws ssm describe - parameters --profile attacker aws ssm get - parameters --names \"gd_prod_dbpwd_sample\" --profile attacker aws ssm get - parameters --names \"gd_prod_dbpwd_sample\" --with-decryption --profile attacker aws ssm delete - parameter --name \"gd_prod_dbpwd_sample\" --profile attacker","title":"Overview and Environment Setup"},{"location":"setup/#environment-setup","text":"","title":"Environment Setup"},{"location":"setup/#prerequisites","text":"AWS Account : Given that you will be simulating attacks and doing remediations, you should run this in a non-production account.

You grabbed a cup of coffee, sat down in your cube, opened up your laptop and begin to go through your emails. Soon after you begin though you start receiving emails indicating that GuardDuty has detected new threats. You don\u2019t yet know the extent of the threats but you quickly begin to investigate. Now the good news is that your coworker Alice has already set up some hooks for specific findings so that they will be automatically remediated. The first email you receive from GuardDuty indicates that one of your EC2 instances might be compromised: GuardDuty Finding | ID: 1xx: The EC2 instance i-xxxxxxxxx may be compromised and should be investigated Shortly after the first email, you receive a second email indicating that the same GuardDuty finding has been remediated: GuardDuty Remediation | ID: 1xx: GuardDuty discovered an EC2 instance (Instance ID: i-xxx) that is communicating outbound with an IP Address on a threat list that you uploaded. All security groups have been removed and it has been isolated. Please follow up with any additional remediation actions. Architecture Evaluation When Alice setup the hook for notifications she only included certain information about the finding because she had also setup a Lambda function to automatically isolate the instance and send out the details of the remediation. Since the finding has been remediated you decide you still want to take a closer look at the setup Alice currently has in place. Investigation Browse to the GuardDuty console to investigate Although you can view the GuardDuty findings in the console, most customers aggregate all findings across their regions and accounts to a central security information and event management (SIEM) system for analysis and remediation. A common approach for aggregating these findings is to setup GuardDuty in a Master/Member structure and then use a workflow including CloudWatch Event Rules and Lambda Functions to push findings to your SIEM or a centralized logging framework. There are also partner solutions that publish Lambda Function Blueprints to make it easier to consolidate findings. Navigate to the GuardDuty console (us-west-2). If there is nothing displayed click the refresh button. A finding should show up with the type UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MaliciousIPCaller.Custom . Based on the format you reviewed earlier can you determine the security issue by the finding type? The quick view of the finding shows a severity symbol, the finding type, the affected resource, the last time the finding was detected, and a count of the subsequent occurrences of an existing finding. Findings are available in the service for 90 days. The finding type indicates that an EC2 instance in your environment is communicating outbound to an IP address included on a custom threat list . Click on Lists in the left navigation to view the custom threat list Alice added. GuardDuty uses managed threat intelligence provided by AWS Security and third-party providers, such as ProofPoint and CrowdStike. You can expand the monitoring scope of GuardDuty by configuring it to use your own custom trusted IP lists and threat lists. If you setup a Master/Member GuardDuty structure, users from the Master GuardDuty account can manage trusted IP lists and threats lists and they are inherited by the member accounts. Users from the member accounts are not able to modify the lists. Scenario Note The EC2 instance indicated by this finding is actually just connecting to an Elastic IP (EIP) on another instance in the same VPC to keep the scenario localized to your environment. The CloudFormation template automatically created the threat list and added the EIP for the malicious instance to the list. View the CloudWatch Event rule Alice used CloudWatch Event Rules to send the email you received about the findings and also to take remediations steps. Examine the CloudWatch Events console to understand what Alice configured and to see how the remediation was triggered. Navigate to the CloudWatch console (us-west-2) and on the left navigation, under the Events section, click Rules . You will see three Rules in the list that were created by the CloudFormation template. All of these begin with the prefix \u201c GuardDuty-Event .\" Click on the rule named GuardDuty-Event-EC2-MaliciousIPCaller . Under the Targets section you will see two entries, one for a Lambda function and one for an SNS Topic. The CloudWatch Event Rule publishes the finding to the SNS Topic which in turn sends out an email notification. Rather than sending the entire JSON event you can see how Alice customized the email by using an input transformer . View the Remediation Lambda function The Lambda function is what handles the remediation logic for this finding. Alice setup the Lambda function to remove the compromised instance from its current security group and add it to one with no ingress or egress rules so that the instance is isolated from the network. Click the Resource Name for the Lambda function in the Targets section to evaluate the remediation logic. Collapse the Designer tab and scroll down to view the code for this function (walking through the code logic is outside the scope of this scenario). You can also click the Monitoring tab and view the invocation details for this function. What permissions does the Lambda Function need to perform the remediation? Verify that the remediation was successful Next, double check the effects of the remediation to ensure the instance is isolated. At this point you have the instance ID of the compromised instance from the email notifications and the name of the isolation security group name from reviewing the Lambda Function code. Browse to the EC2 console (us-west-2) and click Running Instances . You should see three instances with names that begin with GuardDuty-Example . Click on the instance with the instance ID you saw in the GuardDuty finding or email notifications. GuardDuty-Example: Compromised Instance: Scenario 1 . After reviewing the remediation Lambda Function you know that the instance should now have the Security Group with a name that includes ForensicSecurityGroup . Under the Description tab verify the instance has this security group. Initially, all three of the instances launched by the CloudFormation template were in the Security Group with a name that includes TargetSecurityGroup . The Lambda function removed the TargetSecurityGroup from the instance and added the ForensicsSecurityGroup to isolate the instance.
